# Meshtastic Configurator

This project is a web-based Meshtastic configurator that generates QR codes for setting up Meshtastic devices. It allows users to input channel configurations, generate Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs), and generate Meshtastic-compatible URLs and QR codes.

## Features

- Generate Meshtastic-compatible QR codes for device configuration
- Dynamically generate Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs)
- Configure channel settings like region and channel name
- Use Protobuf to encode settings for the Meshtastic protocol

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development environment:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **Yarn** (>= 1.x)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Georepublic/meshtastic-configurator.git
cd meshtastic-configurator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

To install all the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

This project uses **Vite** for development. You can run the project in development mode with automatic TypeScript and hot-module reloading by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The project should now be running on `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if `5173` is occupied).

### 4. Project Structure

- **`src/`**: This folder contains all the TypeScript files and the `main.ts` entry point.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file located in the project root.
- **`dist/`**: The compiled and optimized output for production (generated by `yarn build`).
- **`node_modules/`**: This folder contains all the installed dependencies.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.
- **`package.json`**: Project manifest file.

### 5. Build for Production

If you want to build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will compile and optimize the TypeScript files into the `dist/` directory, ready to be served by a production server.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, use:

```bash
yarn serve
```

This will serve the files from the `dist/` directory and make them accessible locally.

### 7. Adding New Features

- To modify the configurator or add new features, edit the files in the `src/` folder. The development server (`yarn dev`) will automatically recompile and reload the project in your browser with hot-module replacement.

### 8. How It Works

This project uses the **Meshtastic JavaScript API** (`@meshtastic/js`) to generate a valid Meshtastic URL from the input data. It also uses **Protobuf** to encode channel configurations, which are then converted to Base64 and displayed as a QR code.

- **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)**: The PSK is randomly generated as a 32-character hexadecimal string.
- **Channel Settings**: Users can configure the channel name and select a region for the LoRa network.
- **QR Code Generation**: A QR code is generated using the `qrcode` library, which encodes the Meshtastic URL that can be scanned by devices.
